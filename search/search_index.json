This project brings Polylith to Python. Polylith is using a components-first architecture. You can think of it as building blocks, very much like LEGO bricks. All code lives in a Monorepo, available for reuse. Python code - the bricks - is separated from the infrastructure and the actual packaging or building of the deployable artifacts.</p>"},{"location":"#what-problems-does-the-polylith-architecture-solve","title":"What problems does the Polylith Architecture solve?","text":"<p>Polylith offers a solution to the Microservice vs Monolith tradeoffs.

In addition to that, Polylith is very much about the Developer Experience. It has support for REPL Driven Development - a workflow that makes coding both joyful and interactive.</p> <p>If you can improve just one thing in your software development, make it getting faster feedback. <sup>1</sup></p> <p>This type of Architecture will also let you postpone design decisions if you like, such as going for a Monolith or REST Microservices or Serverless functions.

It can also be a thin wrapper around a third party tool.</p> <p>Simple is better than complex. <sup>2</sup></p> <p>In Python, a file is a module. One or more modules in a folder becomes a package. A good thing with this is that the code will be namespaced when importing it. Where does the idea of bricks fit in here? Well, a brick is a Python namespace package.
