# About this Open Source Project

Currently, there is one maintainer of
_the Python tools for the Polylith Architecture_ and several contributors.

## What's the impact if the development of this project would go stale?
The development of this tool has been on a constant pace since the beginning,
and new features and versions are deployed regularly. But The Future is unknown,
what will happen if the maintainers won't be able to continue the development?

The _Python tools for the Polylith Architecture_ is primarily there for a great Developer Experience. 
With the tool, you can visualize the Monorepo, create bricks and projects in a simple way
and you can easily validate the dependencies.

The tooling is not incorporated into your source code, and you won't be "vendor locked-in" as with a Framework.
Polylith is not a Framework. Migrating _away_ from Polylith is really simple too.
You do that with [one single command](migrating.md#migrating-away-from-polylith)!

Additionally, this is an Open Source project and can (of course) be forked with continous development.
