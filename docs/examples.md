# Examples

## Example code
Here are some examples of how to setup __Python__ with the Polylith Architecture.

- [Python Polylith Examples](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example) repository by David Vujic
- [Python Polylith Microservices Example](https://github.com/ttamg/python-polylith-microservices-example) by Matt Gosden

You will find examples of sharing code between different kind of projects, developer tooling configuration such as `mypy` and the `venv`,
and development setup for REPL Driven Development or Jupyter notebooks.

In addition to the examples, there is also the actual [Python tools for the Polylith Architecture](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith) repo, that itself is a Polylith Workspace.
