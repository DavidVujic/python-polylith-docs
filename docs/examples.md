## Example code repositories
Here are some examples of how to setup __Python__ with the Polylith Architecture.

- Python Polylith Example Monorepo
    - [for Poetry](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example)
    - [for Hatch](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example-hatch)
    - [for PDM](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example-pdm)
    - [for Rye](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example-rye)

You will find examples of sharing code between different kind of projects, developer tooling configuration such as `mypy` and the `venv`,
and development setup for REPL Driven Development or Jupyter notebooks.
