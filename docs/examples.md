# Examples & Production Systems

## Example code repositories
Here are some examples of how to setup __Python__ with the Polylith Architecture.

- Python Polylith Example Monorepo

- [Aws CDK App with Polylith](https://github.com/ybenitezf/cdk_polylith) by Yoel BenÃ­tez Fonseca

You will find examples of sharing code between different kind of projects, developer tooling configuration such as `mypy` and the `venv`,
and development setup for REPL Driven Development or Jupyter notebooks.
