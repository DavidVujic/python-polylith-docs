# Installation

## Install Poetry & plugins
With the `Poetry` version 1.2 or later installed, you can add plugins.

Add the [Multiproject](https://github.com/DavidVujic/poetry-multiproject-plugin) plugin,
that will enable the very important __Workspace__ support to Poetry.
``` shell
poetry self add poetry-multiproject-plugin
```

Add the Polylith plugin:
``` shell
poetry self add poetry-polylith-plugin
```

Done!
