# Commands

## Create a repository
Create a directory for your code, initialize it with __git__ and create a basic __Poetry__ setup:

``` shell
git init
```

``` shell
poetry init
```

From the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#init):
> This command will help you create a pyproject.toml file interactively by prompting you to provide basic information about your package. It will interactively ask you to fill in the fields, while using some smart defaults.


Next step: create a Polylith Workspace (continue to [commands](commands.md)).
